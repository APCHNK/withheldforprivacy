            <p>
              Withheld for Privacy, first and foremost, is a privacy company.
              Privacy is the purpose of our services. Moreover, our mission is
              to pioneer and establish the most innovative privacy-by-design
              principles for new products and services on the internet in
              compliance with the applicable laws, including the General Data
              Protection Regulation (GDPR).
            </p>
            <p>
              We partner specifically with Registrars to enable them to provide
              anonymous privacy protected domain registration for their
              customers/domain registrants by using our services (which are
              described more fully in our Registrar Partner Terms of Service.)
            </p>
            <p>
              This privacy statement is meant to provide transparent and
              complete details regarding the collection, processing and sharing
              of personal information we collect.
            </p>
          </article>
          <article>
            <h2>Use of our Domain Privacy Services</h2>
            <p>
              Registrars partner with us to purchase licenses to use our
              Services for their Customers. While our client is a registrar,
              this section provides details on personal information that we
              collect on end-user/Customers who are domain registrants.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Customer personal Information collected, processed, shared:
                None.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are a
              <em><b>Customer of a registrar who uses our Services</b></em
              >, we want you to know that
              <em
                ><b>we do not collect any personal information about you</b></em
              >. We don’t need it. In fact, registrars are prohibited from
              sharing your PI with us under our Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>Cool, right?</p>
            <p>
              You should also know that, because registrars are our clients,
              Customers of our registrar clients do not have third-party
              beneficiary rights. What this means is that we do not owe a duty
              or an obligation to the Customer. Rather, our duties and
              obligations run to the registrar with whom the Customer has
              contracted for these services. We spell this out in our ToS but,
              because we value transparency, we want to share them again with
              any Customers reviewing this privacy statement.

            <h2>Use of our Site (aka When You Visit our Site)</h2>
            <p>
              Our website was created to serve two purposes. First, we seek to
              provide information for registrars who are considering the use of
              our Services. We want you to know more about our Services, the
              terms you will need to agree to and how to contact us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Second, we seek to provide transparent information about our
              Services for Customers of registrars who offer to the Customers
              our WfP services. We are passionate about privacy, proud of our
              Services and want registrar Customers to know why. We know of no
              other domain privacy service that matches our privacy standards.
              So, if you’re a Customer of a registrar that provides our Services
              and you’ve not done it yet, we hope you join us in applauding your
              registrar of choice. With our Services, your registrar ensures
              that your personal information, as their domain Customer, isn’t
              subject to unnecessary onward sharing and that, as their Customer,
              you don’t have to examine a long, complicated set of privacy
              policies in order to figure out the collection/use/processing and
              further sharing of your personal information. Whew!
            </p>
            <p>
              With our site, as you probably can tell, our is intent is to be an
              information provider to others, not gather information about you.
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, we want everyone visiting our site to easily find the
              information they need and to have no glitches. So, we collect
              minimal information that is intended to analyze user traffic
              patterns.

            <p>
              <span class="text-underline">Registrar Data Subjects</span>. If
              you are a Customer of a registrar who is our client, you must
              contact the registrar directly for any Data Subject Requests. WfP
              does not collect nor do we have any personal information about you
              as a Customer. Thus, any inquiry could not result in a substantive
              response as our services consist of an algorithmic randomization
              of Customer’s contact information.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-underline">Third-party Inquiries</span>. If you
              are a third-party (private or public agency such as law
              enforcement) who is investigating use of a domain and/or seek
              domain registrant information where a registrar provides our
              Services, you must contact the registrar or registrant directly.
              We hold no information about the Customers of our clients and our
              clients control the use of our Services.
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, please take note of the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our ToS specifically disclaims third-party beneficiaries. If you
                are a not a registrar in contract with us (aka a third party)
                this means, so you know, you are prohibited from asserting any
                claims that deal with/rely upon our Services.
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP is wholly-based in Iceland. If you believe you have a claim
                against us, it must be asserted exclusively before the Courts of
                Reykjavik, Iceland under Icelandic law.
              </li>
              <li>
                Iceland, which is why we love it here, is a staunch protector of
                privacy rights.
