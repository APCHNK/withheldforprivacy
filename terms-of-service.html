            <p>
              We are Withheld for Privacy (“WfP”). WfP is an Icelandic company
              that focuses solely on privacy. We partner with Registrars to
              enable them to provide anonymous privacy protected domain
              registration for their customers/domain registrants through the
              provision of our services.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to any terms included in our private Registrar Partner
              contract, if you are a Registrar, you agree to these Registrar
              Partner Terms of Service (“ToS”). We include these specific terms
              on our website to provide transparency to your customers/domain
              registrants (“Customers.”) In this ToS, “you” and “your” refer to
              you, or any agent, employee, servant or person authorized to act
              on your behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
              We provided headings to our ToS for convenience purposes only.
              They do not nor are they meant to limit, define, construe or
              describe the scope or extent of each section or in any way affect
              such section.

            <h2>1. OUR SERVICES</h2>
            <p>
              WfP provides privacy protection services for domain registrations
              to prevent the publication of personal information contained in
              the domain’s Whois records (“Services”).
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Services cover all the necessary elements to keep your
              Customer’s information non-published while ensuring that there are
              means for third parties to reach your Customer anonymously.
              Specifically, we agree to the use of our physical address and
              phone/fax numbers to receive, as necessary and reasonable, third
              party outreach and transmit it to your Customers. In addition, we
              provide anonymized email solutions that allow third parties to
              contact your Customer directly without disclosing your Customers
              personal email information.
            </p>
            <p>
              You agree that WfP Services will be used solely for protecting
              domain Whois information from publication and ensuring the
              Customer(s)’s privacy. You further agree that you will only use
              our Services for this purpose and in compliance with ICANN, the
              GDPR, in compliance with registry rules allowing or prohibiting
              privacy services and other authorities and/or laws to which you
              are subject and the laws of Iceland.
            </p>

            <h2>2. CUSTOMER PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
            <p>
              WfP was built using privacy by design principles. We do not
              collect, nor do we need or require, your Customer’s personal
              information in the use of our Services. Our Services were built to
              keep your Customers information within your control and our
              intention is to keep it that way. We believe that is why you chose
              us.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, consistent with this mutual goal, you agree and warrant
              that you will not and do not provide the Customer personal
              information as part of this Agreement. You also agree to disclose
              this fact in your online Privacy Statement/Policy and any online
              legal notifications that may be relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
              For more information about our Privacy Statement, which covers
              your company and your Customers, see

            <p>
              As to privacy regulations, each Party warrants that they do not
              share personal information with the other for any reason,
              including that there is no sale of such information between the
              parties.

            <h2>3. ADDITIONAL REGISTRAR RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
            <p>
              <span class="text-underline">Responsible Use</span>. In using our
              Services, you agree that you are responsible for legal and
              responsible use. WfP expects that you will and you agree to set
              Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies (collectively
              “Registrar Policies”) that govern how you provide our Services.
              You also agree to ensure that your Registrar Policies include
              compliance regulations to which you are subject. You also agree to
              ensure that your Customers follow your own Terms of Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-underline"
                >Legal + Law Enforcement Requests</span
              >. You agree and acknowledge that your use of our Services is at
              an enterprise level. This means that WfP provides and you contract
              for enterprise-wide application of our Services, in compliance
              with these ToS.
            </p>
            <p>
              To that end, you agree that you are the sole contact for any legal
              and/or law enforcement requests and that WfP will redirect any
              such requests they receive. You agree that WfP contracts with you
              alone and not with your Customers. You also agree to provide
              information on your website that is easy to find and clearly
              explains that: 1) WfP does not have your Customer’s Whois
              information or any other personal information; 2) you, not WfP,
              control the application and/or removal of privacy services; and 3)
              WfP will redirect all information requests back to you, as
              registrar.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-underline">Customer Disclosures</span>. You
              agree to the following terms and also agree to disclose them to
              your Customers:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                WfP is an Iceland company focused on privacy and provides
                privacy Services for domain Whois only.
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP is subject to the standards of the GDPR when it processes
                personal information.
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP does not collect, nor are they provided with, Customer
                personal information.
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP removal of Services may happen in limited situations. While
                WfP cannot disclose Customer personal information because it
                does not have it, there may be circumstances where WfP is
                legally required to stop its provision of Services to specific
                Customers. When/if this is applicable and as possible, WfP will
                notify and work with you in advance, where possible and
                reasonable, so you can determine whether to provide an
                alternative legal measures of privacy to your Customer. In
                addition, you agree that WfP reserves the right, per Reservation
                of Rights in this ToS, to remove any/all Services (i) at the end
                of our contract with you; (ii) when a breach of contract occurs;
                or (iii) when the circumstances meet the agreed upon standards
                for Service removal.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customers have no third-party rights as to WfP. To be clear, the
                Customers are in contractual privity with the registrar and the
                registrar shall be responsible for redressing any disputes,
                which the Customers must address to the registrar.
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP communications: You and your Customers agree:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    WfP will, as reasonable, review communications sent to
                    addresses we provide as part of our Services and transmit as
                    follows.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        For communications received via certified or traceable
                        courier mail (such as UPS, FedEx, or DHL), or
                        first-class mail which does not appear to be unsolicited
                        commercial mail, you agree that WfP may either: ( i)
                        forward such communication to you; or (ii) may attempt
                        to communicate to you a scanned copy of a page of the
                        communication to ascertain how you wish WfP to proceed
                        with respect to that communication. At all times, you
                        agree that you have the direct relationship with your
                        Customers and will determine how to provide such
                        communications to them. For avoidance of doubt, we will
                        NOT deliver any inquiries directly to the Customers.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        WfP may, in its own judgment and discretion, elect to
                        not forward to you such first class postal mail or
                        email, fax, postal mail or telephone communications
                        which appear to be unsolicited communications, which
                        offer or advertise the sale of goods or services or
                        which solicit charitable contributions, or
                        communications which appear to arise from your use of
                        our Services administered as a general mail forwarding
                        service
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        You authorize WfP, on behalf of you and your Customers,
                        to either discard all such communications or return all
                        such communications to sender unopened.

                    You agree and will contractually require your Customers to
                    agree to waive any and all claims arising from failure to
                    receive communications directed to a protected domain name
                    but not forwarded to you by WfP, including where failures
                    arise from WfP's mistake of judgment made in good faith in
                    determining whether a communication is or is not an
                    unsolicited communication.

            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that WfP reserves the right to limit or
              refuse Service to you and/or instruct you regarding individual
              users that are your Customers. Though we will do our best to work
              with you, especially on behalf of the privacy of your Customers,
              WfP reserves the right to alter, suspend, or discontinue our
              Services as outlined in this ToS and also accompanying agreements,
              which include specific situations where WfP may do so without
              prior notice to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also acknowledge that WfP services may become unavailable due
              to maintenance or malfunction of computer equipment or other
              reasons.
            </p>
            <p>
              WfP may also discontinue Services in these limited situations,
              with notice where appropriate:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You have breached any provision of the TOS (or have acted in a
                manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable
                to, comply with the TOS);
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP is required to do so by Law (for example, where the
                provision of our Services is, or becomes, unlawful);
              </li>
              <li>
                The provision of our Services to you is, in WfP’s sole opinion,
                no longer commercially viable; or
              </li>
              <li>
                WfP has elected to discontinue Services (or any part thereof).

            </ul>
            <p>
              You agree that WfP shall not be liable to you or any third party
              for any termination or cancellation of your use of our Services.

            <p>
              You acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for prompt
              payment of our Services. All Services must be paid for in advance
              of use.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="text-underline">Automatic Renewal</span>. Given the
              nature of our privacy Services, unless otherwise agreed to in
              writing, you agree to set up automatic renewal for payment to
              ensure there is no interruption of our Services for your
              Customers. With automatic renewal, you acknowledge and agree that
              Services will be automatically renewed 30 days prior to the end of
              term of your agreement for Services using the payment method
              you’ve chosen. You will be charged either then current rates for
              our Services or rates otherwise agreed to in writing (“Fees”.)
            </p>
            <p>

              current and able to pay the Fee billed. Should your payment method
              fail, WtP will make an additional attempt at payment. If payment
              is still unsuccessful, in addition to the WtP rights for
              non-payment, WtP further reserves the right in its sole discretion
              to require payment 60 days in advance and/or escrowed Fees for

              promise to defend, indemnify and hold WFP harmless from the costs
              and liabilities described in this paragraph. Such written
              assurances may include, in WFP's sole discretion, the posting of a

              guarantee payment. Your failure to provide such assurances may be
              considered by WFP to be a breach of this TOS by you and may, in

              disposition of domain name services for which you are the
